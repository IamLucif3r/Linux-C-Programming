# Introduction to Linux C Programming

## 📌 Overview
Welcome to the **Linux C Programming for System Development & Exploitation** repository! This documentation serves as a structured guide to learning C programming for low-level Linux system development and security research.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Learn C programming from fundamentals to advanced system-level programming.
- Gain hands-on experience with **system calls, process control, memory management, and debugging**.
- Explore **exploitation techniques, buffer overflows, and process injection**.
- Contribute to the open-source community by learning and sharing knowledge.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites
Before diving into this guide, ensure you have the following:
- **Basic Knowledge** of Linux terminal commands.
- **A Linux Environment** (Ubuntu, Arch, Fedora, etc.) or WSL for Windows users.
- **Essential Tools Installed:**
  ```bash
  sudo apt update && sudo apt install gcc gdb make strace ltrace
  ```
- A **text editor** such as `vim`, `nano`, or `VS Code`.

## 📂 Structure of Documentation
The guide is divided into multiple sections for a structured learning experience:

1. **C Basics** – Learn the fundamentals of C programming.
2. **Pointers & Memory Management** – Understand pointers and dynamic memory allocation.
3. **System Calls & Process Control** – Learn how to interact with the Linux kernel.
4. **Debugging & Optimization** – Use `gdb`, `strace`, `valgrind`, and `perf`.
5. **Security & Exploitation** – Explore buffer overflows, shellcode writing, and process injection.
6. **Advanced Topics** – Kernel programming, Linux modules, and rootkits.

## 🔥 Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iamlucif3r/Linux-C-Programming.git
   cd Linux-C-Programming/docs
   ```
2. Begin with **C Basics** (`01_C_Basics.md`).
3. Follow the roadmap to progress step by step.
4. Experiment with provided exercises and projects.
